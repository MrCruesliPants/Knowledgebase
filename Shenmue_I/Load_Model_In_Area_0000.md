As an example, it loads the model of Nozomi's Harasaki (HRSK) into the scene.
The model/NPC that has been loaded/spawned, it is not interactable.
For more information on MAPINFO's data, read "[Analysis of a simple MAPINFO](Analysis_of_a_simple_MAPINFO.md)".

How to load (almost) any other character/model (using the modified data of the MAPINFO):
- Change (the 1 reference of) HRSK to the ID of the Character you want to load.
- Change (the 2 references of) NZM_M to the Model Name of that Character.
- Change (the 1 reference of) NZM_F accordingly. The "_F" part means this is a reference for what Face to load.
