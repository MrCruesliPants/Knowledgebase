Hidden raffle prizes (?)
Fast movement (move faster. Or perhaps fight faster?)
Fly (a more reliable flying code, to walk in the air anywhere)
Hack NPC spawns (make any NPC spawn in Dobuita, for example)
Ryo X + Y + Z pos (fix Ryo's current X or Y position)
Jump to location (jump to any specified area when you exit one)
Retro Hazuki residence outside (like it is in the memories custcene, with the falling cherry blossoms)
