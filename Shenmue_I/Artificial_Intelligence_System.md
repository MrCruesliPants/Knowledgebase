# Artificial Intelligence System

We cannot directly edit the AI system since its mostly at code level, but we can alter things that use the AI system to note the differences in behavior.



## Mapinfo tweaking and its behavior on the AI system

In mapinfo, you will find random references to pointers in HUMANS. For instance, in JU00 or JU99 you may find references to the CAT/Kitten in the shrine. If you replace these pointers, you may find that you can adapt a different character to that. [[Example by video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=XY4KpWxCORo)]

Also, you can change Ryo to be other individuals, and by doing that you sometimes will adopt their specific AI sequences.



## What guides the AI system?    

1. Code Level
  1. The Shenmue source code has control over the preset tasks assigned to each user.
    1. No any editable file have been found that controls this, so its closer to code level.
2. Time of Day
  1. Though manipulating the time via the beta debug in game menu, it was possible to make people perform different tasks at will, showing that the code references the time of day to guide NPCs.
3. Free Mode Debug Flags
  1. These on/off switches control which scenes might have been completed by the player, even if they were not. Please see the debug flags page for more info on that.
