# Credits

Most of the pages have been written from [these](https://sites.google.com/site/shenmuemods/contributors) contributors (as listed in the old site).

Github makes it easy to see who has contributed what, therefore in the future it won't be necessary to include the name/credits of the contributor.

* Though, we may list here the Github usernames of the people who have (willingly) contributed in this project.

In case a page contains the work of someone who isn't a contributor (of this repository, but their "outside" work is included here), then at the end of that page due credit is given.
