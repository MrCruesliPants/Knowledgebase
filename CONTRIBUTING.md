## Submitting contributions

### Style Guide of Contributing

* Write as a **professional;** use precise language and convey information in the most *analytical* (step-by-step) and *crystal clear* way possible, to easily be understood by everyone.

  * Write *without ego*; that is, don't use the "I", but rather use the "you"/"we".
  * Write *without emotion*; make your text as "dry" as possible, don't use words as "Enjoy!" and avoid emoticons/emojis as much as possible.
  * This is not a blog, or a platform to promote yourself, and we won't tolerate Internet Personas.
  * Because many people come from game fan web communities, where unnecessary drama and narcissism occurs (and we hope you don't belong in these categories), it is imperative to prevent such motives to enter such a project.

* Write names of games and files, and hexadecimal values, inside \`\` (example: `Shenmue I`, `1ST_READ.BIN`, `0x1234`).
* If a folder has a `readme.md` file which lists Subpages (of that folder), then it would be helpful if you include in that readme/list the (.md file) page you just wrote.
