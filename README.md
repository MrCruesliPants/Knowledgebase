# Shenmue Mods

*Creating, collecting & preserving knowledge of hacking & modding Shenmue games.*

***

#### Style Guide of Contributing:

* Write as a **professional;** use precise language and convey information in the most *analytical* (step-by-step) and *crystal clear* way possible, to be easily understood by everyone.

  * Write *without ego*; that is, don't use the "I", but rather use the "you"/"we".
  * Write *without emotion*; make your text as "dry" as possible, don't use words as "Enjoy!" or emoticons/emojis.
  * This is not a blog, or a platform to promote yourself, and we won't tolerate Internet Personas.
  * *Note*: because many people come from game fan web communities, where unnecessary drama and narcissism occurs (and we hope you don't belong in these categories), it is imperative to prevent such motives entering to such a project.


* Write names of games and files, and hexadecimal values, inside \`\` (example: `Shenmue I`, `1ST_READ.BIN`, `0x1234`).
* If a folder has a `readme.md` file which lists Subpages (of that folder), then it would be helpful if you include the (.md file) page you wrote in that list.

#### Credits:

Most of the pages have been written from [these](https://sites.google.com/site/shenmuemods/contributors) contributors (as listed in the old site).

Github makes it easy to show who have contributed what, therefore in the future it won't be necessary to include the name/credits of the contributor.

In case a page contains work of someone who isn't a contributor (of this repository, but their "outside" work is included here), then at the end of that page due credit is given.
